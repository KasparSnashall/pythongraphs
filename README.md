pythongraphs
============

My python graphing techniques this repo will contain a large variety of fun and inovative graphing techniques. I will try to explain each and every graph or technique with as much detail as possible.

All ipython files (ipynb) can be viewed by tying in my github name into [nbviwer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/KasparSnashall/) this will then display all the proper outputs etcetera. All of these techniques can be found on the internet.
